I usually spend an hour or two a day on tasks that don't allow for reading or actively watching videos. During these times I like to listen to either an audiobook or podcast. Here are a few of the podcasts that I enjoy.

## Programming and Technology

### [Syntax](syntax.fm)
Syntax is primarily a front-end development podcast based mostly on React. I don't do much front-end work at the moment and when I do, I generally use Vue. This is a great podacst, however, and I listen to most of the non-React focused episodes. The hosts are interesting and keep the episodes quick and informative.

### [Rework](rework.fm)
Rework is a podcast by the folks at Basecamp that primarily focuses on the processes around running a business. I listen to this podcast primarily to hear tips around running a startup. 

### [Art + Music + Technology](artmusictech.libsyn.com)
Art + Music + Technology is a podcast that mostly revolves around experimental electronic music and its creation. Darwin interviews people that range from artists, to engineers, to somewhere in between. Many tips also come up here about running a small niche business as well as the more technical side of music technology. 

### [How I Built This with Guy Raz](npr.org/series/490248027/how-i-built-this)
How I Built This is a podcast from NPR where Guy Raz interviews the founders of companies ranging from Whole Foods to Stripe. Guy is a great interviewer who asks interesting questions as the guests tell their stories.

## Comedy and Entertainment

### [Last Podcast on the Left](lpotl.libsyn.com/website)
Last Podcast on the Left is a comedy podcast with a focus on true crime, high strangeness, and conspiracy theories. Unlike some other true crime media, this podcast does not glorify killers in any way, but instead paints them as weak, pathetic losers. This is certainly not a podcast for the faint of heart and can be very crude while also attempting to paint a clear picture of the history. The stories they tell are very well researched and, no matter the subject matter, are always kept entertaining and funny.



## Learning

### [Stuff You Should Know](stuffyoushouldknow.com)
You've probably already heard of this podcast, but it's always a great listen. Josh and Chuck are two guys who can tell an interesting story and always bring a great attitude. I don't listen to every episode of this podcast these days but it's really what got me into podcasts.
